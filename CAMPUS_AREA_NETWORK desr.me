This project is a Packet Tracer simulation of a hierarchical network architecture, consisting of three layers: core, distribution, and access. The purpose of this simulation is to demonstrate the implementation and functionality of various networking concepts such as VLANs, subnetting, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP protocol, and RIP version 2 protocol.

Contents:
1) VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):
VLANs are logical partitions within a physical network that allow for better network management, security, and scalability.
They enable the segmentation of a network into smaller broadcast domains, reducing unnecessary traffic and improving network performance.
VLANs can be used to group devices based on their department, function, or security requirements, providing better control and isolation.

2)Subnetting:
Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller subnetworks, known as subnets.
It allows for efficient utilization of IP addresses by allocating them to specific subnets based on network requirements.
Subnetting enables the creation of multiple smaller networks within a larger network, each with its own unique range of IP addresses.

3)Inter-VLAN Routing:
Inter-VLAN routing is the process of forwarding network traffic between different VLANs.
In a hierarchical network architecture, the distribution layer facilitates inter-VLAN routing, allowing communication between devices in different VLANs.
Inter-VLAN routing can be accomplished using a Layer 3 switch or a router, which routes traffic between VLANs based on their IP addresses.

4)DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
DHCP is a network protocol that enables automatic IP address assignment to devices on a network.
It simplifies the management of IP addresses by dynamically allocating them to devices as they connect to the network.
DHCP eliminates the need for manual configuration of IP addresses, providing flexibility and scalability in network deployments.

5)RIP (Routing Information Protocol) Version 2:
RIP is a dynamic routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers in a network.
Version 2 of RIP includes enhancements over its predecessor, supporting the use of subnet masks and allowing for more efficient routing.
RIP version 2 employs the hop count metric to determine the best path for routing network traffic.
